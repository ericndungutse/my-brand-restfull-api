# MY BRAND Rest API

### Project Description

This is a backend for my **portofolio website**. It is meant to provide data to the frontend about me. In addition, it includes blogging functionality, where guest can read blogs I wrote as well as create their own. The blogs can be commented on and be liked. To manage personal data, the api provide different authentication/authorization endpoints.

I built this project to sell myself, but most importantly, as a starting point in **Andela ATLP** program, a nine-month career accelerator empowering Rwandese nationals to become world-class engineers.
